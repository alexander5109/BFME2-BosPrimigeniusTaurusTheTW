- **Shark & Gannicus** for gameplay inspiration from their "MADNESS" maps, where i also learned the commandButton reuse trick.
- **Silverbane** for teaching me the buttonimages trick to be ably to modify commandbuttons, and for his "Osgiliath" map, from which i took his OathBreaker wave for inspiration.
- **BIG[BANG]** for teaching me the DamageSpeed & WeaponSpeed trick on ranged damage nuggets and for prompting me to rewrite my pathfinding scripts.
- **Crusard** for his "Legends" map from which i learned the hiding subobjects trick.
- **BFME2 ROTWK 2.02** for the Blight ability.
- **Thorin** for his continous feedback and ideas, such as Theoden's "Forth and fear no darkness" ability. And finally, for setting up a competitive community of "cowboys" in GameRanger.
- **Guerrilla** for being annoying as shit and continously prompting me to remake my pathfinding, as well forcing me to add hardcoded anti cheats.
